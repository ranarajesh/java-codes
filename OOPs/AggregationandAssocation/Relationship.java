public class Relationship {
    // There are three types of relationship between classes and their object, means how to classes interact with other and how objects are interact with other class objects to perform some task 
    /* 1: IS-A Relationship
    2: Part-Of Relationship : In this relationship, one class object is a component of another class. Given two classes, class A and class B, they are in a part-of relationship if the object of class A is a part of class B, or vice-versa.

    An instance of the component class(es) can only be created inside the containing class. In the example to the right, class B and class C have their own implementations, but their objects are part-of the implementation of Class A and are only created once a class A object is created. Hence, part-of is a dependent relationship.
    3: Has-A Relationship: This is a slightly less concrete relationship between two classes. Class A and class B have a has-a relationship if one or both need the other’s object to perform an operation, but both class objects can exist independently of each other.
    This implies that a class has-a reference to an object of the other class but does not decide the lifetime of the other class’s referenced object.
    
    Association#
    In object-oriented programming, association is the common term used for both the has-a and part-of relationships but is not limited to these. When we say that two objects are in an association relationship, this is a generic statement which means that we don’t worry about the lifetime dependency between the objects. The specialized forms of association:  Aggregation(has-a) and Composition(part-of)
