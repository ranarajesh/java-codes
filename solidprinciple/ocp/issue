OPen and Closed Principle(OCP):

This principle states that “software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension,
but closed for modification” which means you should be able to extend a class behavior, without modifying it.

if you want to introduced send OTP via mobile Phone or WhatsApp number then you need to modify source code in Notification Service right ?

Here What OCP says , It open for Extension but close for modification hence its not recommended to modify Notification Service for each OTP Feature , it will violate OCP

So to overcome this you need to design your code in such a way that everyone can reuse your feature by just extending it and if they need any customization they can extend it and add their feature on top of it like a abstraction .
